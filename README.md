## About The Project

[![Braze Panel Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://braze.fla.herty.xyz)

After several attempts at working nicely with solder, I'd had enough of setting up legacy versions of PHP and composer. I decided to create this project as a means of helping anyone else who has trouble with the official solder release.

Braze (mainly) fixes:
* Difficulty in set up
* The cumbersome process of adding mods to solder

This project is still a work in progress - please suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks in advance to all the people may contribute to expanding Braze!

A list of open source projects that made this possible are listed in the 'Thanks' section.

### Built With

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
