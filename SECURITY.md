## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project is still in active development. If you find a vulnerability, please report it by creating a GitHub issue, as the software is not yet production ready, so
responsible disclosure practices are not necessary. 

Reporting via a GitHub issue is also beneficial as it allows anyone to work on the problem and create a PR - it is open-source after all!
